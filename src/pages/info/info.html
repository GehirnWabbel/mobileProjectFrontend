      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:<br>

      You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br><br>

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>

            reason or for no reason at any time upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may terminate this EULA immediately upon written notice to
            Licensee in the event the Company believes Licensee has breached <a href="#2">Section 2</a> or
            <a href="#4">4</a> herein. Upon termination of this EULA, the license granted to the SDK pursuant to
            <a href="#1">Section 1</a> shall immediately terminate and Licensee shall no longer have any rights to use
            the SDK. Licensee understands, however, that the collection of data by the SDK through Properties on which
            it is already integrated, and its use for purposes set forth herein, may continue until End Users have (a)
            removed or disabled the SDK (or any application that integrates the SDK) from their respective devices, or
            any application that integrates the SDK from your device, or (b) limited such data collection through

          <li id="4"><span>Compliance with COPPA</span> : Licensee shall not use the SDK in conjunction
            with a Property that is directed to children under the age of 13. Licensee shall not use the SDK to
            knowingly send to Company personal information (as defined under COPPA), including device identifiers or

          </li>
          <li id="5"><span>Use and Ownership of SDK Data.</span> Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the
            SDK enables Licensee to collect certain information from end users (“End Users”) of the SDK’s functionality
            (collectively, “SDK Information”), which generally helps provide developers with functionality to target and
            personalize the notifications they send to end users. This data collected includes: End Users’ mobile
            advertising identifiers, such as Apple IDFAs and Android Advertising identifiers; End Users’ email addresses
            End Users’ IP address, device push token, precise location (e.g., GPS-level) data, network information,
            language, time zone, product preferences, and privacy preferences. The Parties shall jointly own the SDK
            Information, and each Party shall be entitled (without further compensation to the other) to use, share,
            market, license, sell, store, and otherwise exploit the SDK Information to the maximum extent permitted by
            law, which shall include using the SDK Information for cross-app, cross-device, and other interest-based
            advertising, analytics and market research. Without limiting the foregoing, neither Party shall use SDK
            Information for any of the following purposes: (a) employment eligibility, (b) credit eligibility, (c)
            health card eligibility, or (d) insurance eligibility, underwriting, or pricing.
          </li>
          <li id="6"><span>Privacy Compliance.</span> The Parties agree to comply with all applicable
            privacy laws, and each respective party agrees to perform the following obligations:
            <ol>
              <li>Licensee is responsible for obtaining all applicable consents required to enable OneSignal to collect
                information from End User’s device or browser. Licensee shall publish privacy policies and disclosures
                for the Properties that comply with applicable law and the terms of this EULA, including, but not
                limited to, clearly disclosing that the SDK Information will be collected and how it may be used, as set
                forth in <a href="#5">Section 5</a> above.
              </li>
              <li>Each Party shall at all times comply with its respective published privacy policies and disclosures,
                and each party shall at all times post a privacy policy on its website that describes how it collects,
                uses and shares information, and that provides information about how an End User can opt out of
                interest-based advertising (e.g., online behavioral or mobile cross-app advertising).
              </li>
              <li>Where Licensee provides data (such as IDFAs, Android Ad IDs, or location data) in a manner other than
                through Company’s proprietary SDK, including without limitation through an API or an SDK proprietary to
                the Licensee, Licensee shall be responsible for ensuring ensure that any collection and transfer of data
                is done in compliance with user’s stated preferences, including without limitation devices settings to
                “Limit Ad Tracking” and “Opt Out of interest-based ads.”
              </li>
              <li>Licensee shall notify Company in writing of any further data usage or governance requirements,
                restrictions or limitations, to the extent they apply, in which case the Parties may execute a further,
                paid subscription plan setting out such limitations and licensing payments to supplement the terms
                herein.

                data, trade secrets, business information, and any other information disclosed, in writing, visually, or
                orally by or on behalf of a Party (“Discloser”) to the other Party (“Recipient”) or to which Recipient
                obtains access in connection with the negotiation or performance of this EULA that is marked as
                “proprietary,” “confidential,” “trade secret,” or in some other manner to indicate that Discloser
                considers it to be commercially sensitive, or which a reasonable person would understand to be
                commercially sensitive. SDK Information shall not be Confidential Information, but rather shall be
                subject to <a href="#2">Section 2</a> hereof. Confidential Information shall not include information
                that: (i) is already rightfully known to Recipient at the time it obtains Confidential Information from
                Discloser; (ii) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure in
                breach of this EULA or any other confidentiality obligations; (iii) is lawfully received on a
                nonconfidential basis from a third party authorized to disclose such information without restriction and
                without breach of this EULA; (iv) is contained in, or is capable of being discovered through examination
                of, publicly available records or materials; or (v) is developed by a Party without the use of any
                Confidential Information provided by the other Party.
              </li>
              <li>Discloser’s Confidential Information shall remain the property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not
                be deemed, by virtue of this EULA or any access to Discloser’s Confidential Information, to have
                acquired any right, title, or interest in or to Discloser’s Confidential Information. Recipient agrees:
                (a) to hold Discloser’s Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) to limit disclosure of
                Discloser’s Confidential Information to Recipient’s own employees and contractors who have a need to
                know Discloser’s Confidential Information for the purposes of this EULA and who have been advised of,
                and are bound to observe and comply with, Recipient’s obligations hereunder; (c) not to otherwise
                disclose any of Discloser’s Confidential Information to any third party; (d) to use the Confidential
                Information solely and exclusively in accordance with the terms of this EULA in order to carry out its
                obligations and exercise its rights under this EULA; (e) to afford Discloser’s Confidential Information
                at least the same level of protection against unauthorized disclosure or use as Recipient normally uses
                to protect its own information of a similar character, but in no event, less than reasonable care; and
                (f) to notify Discloser promptly of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Discloser’s Confidential
                Information and to cooperate with and assist Discloser in every reasonable way to stop or minimize such
                unauthorized use or disclosure.
              </li>
              <li>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event Recipient is required to disclose any of
                Discloser’s Confidential Information under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued
                by a court of competent jurisdiction or by a demand or information request from any regulatory
                authority, Recipient shall, unless prohibited by the terms of a subpoena, order, or demand: (a) promptly
                notify Discloser of the existence, terms, and circumstances surrounding such demand or request; (b)
                consult with Discloser on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such
                subpoena, order, or demand; and (c) if disclosure of such Confidential Information is required, exercise
                its reasonable best efforts to narrow the scope of disclosure and obtain an order or other reliable
                assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such Confidential Information. To the extent
                Recipient is prohibited from notifying Discloser of such a subpoena, order, or demand, by the terms of
                same, Recipient shall exercise its reasonable efforts to narrow the scope of disclosure.
              </li>
              <li>Upon the termination of this EULA, Recipient shall promptly return (or destroy if directed by
                Discloser) all of Discloser’s Confidential Information in its possession or in the possession of any
                employee or contractor of Recipient.
